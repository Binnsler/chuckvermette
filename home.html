            <p>"I have been a musician for the majority of my life, and have spent the better half of it dedicated to creating recordings professionally. Following the release of my first full length album as an engineer, I was trained for several years by my mentor and friend Bob Yen Jr. I have recorded for CBS programming, and also have served as a mixing and recording engineer for many projects tapped for Grammy nominations. I continue to hone my skills, and develop my craft as both the Engineer for Area Twenty-Two, and the technician for the recording projects for Johnny "Drama" Alves (of Wahlburger's on A&E)."</p>
